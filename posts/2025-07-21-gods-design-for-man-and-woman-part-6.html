        <h2>God’s Design for Man and Woman: A Comprehensive Case for Complementarianism, Part 6</h2>
        <p><em>Posted on 07/21/2025 at The Curmudgeon’s Chronicle</em></p>

        <h3>Biblical Femininity: Strength and Beauty in God’s Design</h3>
        <p>In 2024, Hannah Pearl Davis, a YouTuber dubbed the “female Andrew Tate,” sparked X outrage by promoting male dominance, drawing feminist and conservative backlash for her anti-feminist extremes. Meanwhile, Jen Wilkin, a Bible teacher urging churches to empower women within biblical roles, faced egalitarian cries of “soft patriarchy” and patriarchal accusations of feminism for her Gospel Coalition talks. Their contrasting visions ignite debates, raising the question: what is true Biblical femininity? This sixth article explores God’s design – strength and wisdom in Proverbs 31 and Titus 2 – for women to flourish as complements to men.</p>

        <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
        <p>Picture a young woman in your church, wrestling with her identity. Culture bombards her with conflicting messages: feminism demands sameness with men, while voices like Hannah Pearl Davis insist women are lesser, subject to male control with fewer privileges than men. Amid this noise, Jen Wilkin, an evangelical Bible teacher, urges women to teach and serve within Scripture’s boundaries, drawing fire from egalitarians, who want no limits, and patriarchists, who see her as too progressive. These clashes reflect a deeper question: How can women embrace God’s design in a world that distorts femininity? </p>
        <p>This series builds a case for complementarianism: men and women, equal in worth but distinct in roles, reflect God’s glory. The Bible reveals Eve as עֵזֶר (ezer, helper) in Genesis 2:18, complementing Adam’s leadership, grounds male eldership in 1 Timothy 2:12, and exposes egalitarianism’s selective hermeneutics. Now, we explore biblical femininity – strength, wisdom, and beauty rooted in Proverbs 31, Titus 2, and Ephesians 5:22–24. Unlike Davis’ rigid secular patriarchy or egalitarianism’s role erasure, God’s design equips women to shine as partners in His kingdom. Let’s study Scripture together, praying for wisdom to live out God’s call.</p>

        <h3>Biblical Femininity: Core Teachings and Strengths</h3>
        <p>Scripture paints a vibrant portrait of femininity, celebrating women’s distinct contributions within God’s design. Far from cultural stereotypes – whether feminism’s rejection of roles or Davis’ demand for female subservience – biblical womanhood radiates strength, wisdom, and purpose, complementing male leadership. Let’s unpack key passages and examples to see how women flourish as equals with unique callings.</p>

        <img src="/images/man_woman_series/complementary_colors.png" alt="Complementary colors with silhouettes, reflecting strength in biblical femininity." class="centered-image mid-post">

        <h3>Proverbs 31: Strength and Wisdom</h3>
        <p>Proverbs 31:10–31 describes the “virtuous woman” (אֵשֶׁת־חַיִל, eshet-chayil, woman of strength). She’s no passive figure: “She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands” (v. 13), managing her household with industry. “She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness” (v. 26), teaching with grace. Her influence shines: “Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her” (v. 28). Brown-Driver-Briggs defines חַיִל (chayil) as “strength, ability,” not mere domesticity.<cite data-ref="bdb"></cite> This woman is entrepreneurial, buying fields (v. 16), yet prioritizes her family. Andreas Köstenberger notes her complementarity: her strength supports her husband’s leadership, fulfilling Genesis 2’s ezer role.<cite data-ref="kostenberger"></cite></p>
        <p>Unlike Davis’ view that women’s value lies in total submission, Proverbs 31 celebrates initiative. Unlike egalitarianism’s push for identical roles, her wisdom complements male headship. Her life reflects the gospel, serving with Christlike love (Ephesians 5:32).</p>

        <h3>Titus 2: Nurturing and Mentorship</h3>
        <p>Titus 2:3–5 instructs older women to be “teachers of good things”, guiding younger women to be σώφρων (sōphrōn, self-controlled) and οἰκουρός (oikouros, keeper of the home). BDAG defines oikouros as “busy at home, carrying out household duties,” emphasizing stewardship, not confinement.<cite data-ref="bdag" data-page="700"></cite> They teach “to love their husbands, to love their children, to be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands” (v. 4–5). This echoes Eve’s role as עֵזֶר (ezer, helper), nurturing family and faith. These roles equip women to disciple others without violating 1 Timothy 2:12’s prohibition on authoritative teaching over men.</p>
        <p>Jen Wilkin’s call for women teachers (e.g., her 2024 Gospel Coalition panel<cite data-ref="tcg"></cite>) embodies this, equipping women for Titus 2 roles while honoring male eldership. Contrast this with Davis’ claim that women’s primary role is subservience, ignoring their mentoring gifts. Titus 2 empowers women to shape generations, reflecting God’s glory.</p>

        <h3>Ephesians 5: Joyful Submission</h3>
        <p>Ephesians 5:22–24 calls wives to “submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.” The Greek ὑποτάσσω (hypotassō, subject oneself, be subjected or subordinated, obey) implies voluntary partnership, not inferiority.<cite data-ref="bdag" data-page="1042"></cite> As discussed in Article 3, husbands lead as κεφαλή (kephalē, head), mirroring Christ’s sacrificial love (v. 25). This submission reflects the church’s trust in Christ –  a “great mystery” (v. 32) – and parallels Christ’s submission to the Father (1 Corinthians 11:3), modeling strength in partnership.</p>
        <p>This counters Davis’ view of women as subordinate in a manner which strips agency. It also challenges egalitarianism’s rejection of submission as oppression. Submission is a calling to trust God’s design, freeing women to serve joyfully.</p>

        <h3>Biblical Examples</h3>
        <p>Scripture showcases women thriving in God’s design:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Mary (Luke 1:38)</b>: Her words, “Be it unto me according to thy word”, model submission to God’s will.</li>
            <li><b>Esther (Esther 4:16)</b>: Her courage – “If I perish, I perish” – shows wisdom and influence within God’s framework.</li>
            <li><b>Lydia (Acts 16:14–15)</b>: A businesswoman and hospitable believer, she supports the church without usurping leadership.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These women contrast Davis’ rigid secular patriarchy and egalitarianism’s role erasure, showing femininity’s strength in complementarity.</p>

        <h3>Strengths of Biblical Femininity</h3>
        <p>Biblical femininity offers purpose: women nurture families (Titus 2), wield wisdom (Proverbs 31), and reflect Christ’s submission (Ephesians 5). It rejects cultural devaluation of homemaking as much as it rejects patriarchal control. Women’s roles glorify God through distinct contributions, partnering with men as “joint heirs” (1 Peter 3:7). This clarity equips women to shine, pointing to the gospel.</p>

        <h3>Cultural and Egalitarian Challenges: Addressing Distortions</h3>
        <p>Sisters, biblical femininity faces a storm of distortions in today’s world, and you’ve likely felt the tension. Voices like Hannah Pearl Davis claim women are lesser – subject to male control with fewer privileges than men. Her secular patriarchy, much like the “red pill” ideology we’ve critiqued before, denies your agency, reducing you to roles far below Proverbs 31’s radiant strength. Similarly, some evangelical circles, like Vision Forum, have pushed Biblical Patriarchy to extremes, viewing husbands as “prophets, priests, and kings” who control every detail of life. Rachel Miller calls this “soul-numbing,”<cite data-ref="miller"></cite> and she’s right – it dims the vibrant calling God designed for you, as Article 2 showed with Eve’s עֵזֶר (ezer, helper) role.</p>
        <p>On the other side, modern feminism often paints submission as weakness, dismissing Titus 2’s call to nurture as oppressive. You’ve likely seen online debates – on X or elsewhere – calling complementarianism, like Jen Wilkin’s or others’, “soft patriarchy,” wrongly viewing Ephesians 5:22–24 as inferiority rather than partnership. This push for sameness erases the complementary strength of the role of helper, described in Genesis 2, leaving no room for the distinct beauty God crafted in you. Egalitarian voices add to the noise, claiming Galatians 3:28 – “There is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus” – wipes out role distinctions.<cite data-ref="payne"></cite> But as Article 4 clarified, this verse speaks of salvation equality, not identical roles. Elevating it over 1 Timothy 2:12’s clear teaching risks twisting Scripture to fit modern ideals.</p>
        <p>Some egalitarians, like William Webb, go further, arguing Ephesians 5:22’s call to submission is merely cultural, a relic to move beyond.<cite data-ref="webb"></cite> Yet Paul grounds submission in creation (1 Timothy 2:13) and Christ’s headship. This isn’t oppression; it’s a gospel picture, reflecting Christ and the church (Ephesians 5:32). Sisters, complementarianism offers clarity: you’re equal image-bearers (Genesis 1:27) with distinct roles (Genesis 2:18). Wilkin’s vision of women teaching women (Titus 2) honors your gifts without overstepping 1 Timothy 2:12. Davis’ control and egalitarianism’s erasure both miss God’s design, but Proverbs 31’s strength calls you to thrive. We must call out abuses – domineering leadership isn’t biblical – but God’s truth equips you to shine, reflecting His glory.</p>

        <h3>Complementarian Response</h3>
        <p>Complementarianism offers clarity: women are equal image-bearers (Genesis 1:27) with distinct roles (Genesis 2:18). Wilkin’s vision – women teaching women (Titus 2) – honors gifts without violating 1 Timothy 2:12, unlike egalitarianism’s role erasure. Davis’ patriarchy, like Vision Forum’s, distorts headship into control, which Ephesians 5:25’s sacrificial love corrects. Complementarianism reflects Christ and the church, avoiding cultural extremes. We must acknowledge abuses (e.g., domineering leadership), but biblical femininity empowers women to thrive, as Proverbs 31 shows.</p>

        <h3>Practical Applications: Living Out Biblical Femininity</h3>
        <p>How can women embody God’s design? Scripture offers practical steps for homes, churches, and society, inspiring women to shine.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>In the Home</b>: Embrace nurturing roles (Titus 2:3–5), whether as wives, mothers, or mentors. Consider Sarah, a women’s ministry leader in my church. She mentors young mothers, teaching them to love their families (Titus 2:4), echoing Wilkin’s call. Her quiet strength counters Davis’ claim that women’s value is only in submission.</li>
            <li><b>In the Church</b>: Serve in non-authoritative roles, like teaching women or children (Titus 2). Women’s ministry leaders can equip others, as Wilkin models, without usurping eldership (1 Timothy 2:12). This honors God’s design while maximizing gifts.</li>
            <li><b>In Society</b>: Use gifts in vocations (e.g., Proverbs 31’s businesswoman) while prioritizing biblical roles, as we will explore later in this series (e.g., women in politics). Lydia’s hospitality (Acts 16:15) shows how women impact society without compromising femininity.</li>
            <li><b>For Singles</b>: Single women, your calling to shine as godly women isn’t tied to marriage but to glorifying God in every season. Ruth’s devotion (Ruth 1:16) models this beautifully – her loyalty to Naomi and trust in God’s plan (Ruth 2:11–12) show a life of service unbound by a husband’s headship. You’re under Christ’s authority (1 Corinthians 11:3), submitting to Him as your ultimate head, whether living with parents or independently. If you’re under your father’s roof, honor him (Exodus 20:12) while seeking God’s guidance on vocation or moving out – Proverbs 3:5–6 urges you to trust the Lord, not rigid rules. Pursue work that reflects Proverbs 31’s industry, like Lydia’s business (Acts 16:14–15), balancing it with service to God’s kingdom. Can you mentor married women? Titus 2:3–5 encourages older women to teach younger ones, so if you’re mature in faith, share wisdom humbly, respecting 1 Timothy 2:12’s boundaries on authoritative teaching over men. Study Scripture, pray, and seek godly counsel (Proverbs 15:22) to discern your path – whether mentoring, serving, or working, your gifts glorify God as equal image-bearers (Genesis 1:27).</li>

        <h3>Conclusion: The Beauty of God’s Design</h3>
        <p>Biblical femininity, rooted in Proverbs 31, Titus 2, and Ephesians 5, equips women to shine with strength and wisdom, complementing men’s leadership. Hannah Pearl Davis’ patriarchal extremes and egalitarianism’s role erasure falter against Scripture’s witness. Jen Wilkin’s vision, though criticized, reflects Titus 2’s call to mentor and serve. Complementarianism offers clarity: women are “joint heirs” (1 Peter 3:7), reflecting Christ and the church (Ephesians 5:32). Women, embrace your calling; men, honor women’s gifts; churches, teach these roles clearly. In our next article, we will explore marriage, applying these truths to husbands and wives. What challenges do you face in living out biblical femininity? Join the conversation, praying for wisdom to reflect God’s glory.</p>
